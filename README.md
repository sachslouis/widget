Test for Taboola

I created this sample clickbait widget for an interview with Taboola. While I didn’t get the job, I was very happy with the product—not only because of the creative clickbait content, but mostly because it is a good example of clean dynamic JavaScript where the only HTML in the body is the script tag for the JavaScript file. 

Looking at the JavaScript, the entire widget is created dynamically by looping through an array of images, and for each of these, creating an item on the widget. We then create a thumbnail image as well a title and a fictitious sponsor by using the same item in their corresponding arrays. I then append the thumbnail pictures, title and branding sponsor to the widget item, and append the item on to the greater widget. 

The CSS is done using flexbox to make it responsive and media queries to change the alignment to a horizontal scroll for a mobile screen.
